<h1>HoneyPi</h1>
<p>HoneyPi is a system that will soon revolutionize the internet as we know it. </p>
<p>Hackers are constantly attacking the internet and vulnerable devices, what if there was some way to stop them?</p>
<p>This is the idea of HoneyPi. Once a hacker tries to hack a HoneyPi too many times and is reported in a database too many times, it will create a master list of IPs that are malicious. Routers that are able to receive this master list will then block all traffic that is coming from these malicious IPs/port combinations. This will prevent malicious attacks on devices within a local network.</p>

<h2>How does/will it work?</h2>
<p>This project is still in very early stages by its developer. When completed, this is the intention of how it will run:</p>
<h3>1. Virtual Machines</h3>
<p>The honeypot will be completely virtual on the Pi with no connections to the host device. This will prevent any attack from trying to infiltrate the linux system by bypassing the virtual machine. If a hacker tries to "silver bullet" the virtual machine, the HoneyPi will temporarily go offline and block all the ports until a new virtual machine can be replicated and all the damaged files are replaced.</p>
<h3>2. Data Keylogger</h3>
<p>The HoneyPi will keep extensive records of the keypresses and any mouse (if applicable) attempts that are made by the hacker on the virtual machine.</p>
<h3>3. Reporting</h3>
<h3>4. Compiling</h3>
<h3>5. List of IPs</h3>
