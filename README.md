<h1>This project is in early development.</h1>
<h3>I am targeting a launch date at the end of September</h3>

<h1>HoneyPi</h1>
<p>HoneyPi is a system that will soon revolutionize the internet as we know it. </p>
<h3>Breaches such as T-Mobile, SSN, and ComCast should NEVER Happen!</h3>
<h3>Critical Information (Credit Crads, SSN, etc.) Should be PROTECTED on the Internet!</h3>
<p>Hackers are constantly attacking servers on the internet and other vulnerable devices, what if there was some way to stop them?</p>
<p>This is the idea behind HoneyPi. That one day, all traffic coming from IP addresses will be blocked by servers until the malformed device is removed from the internet. </p>
